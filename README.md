# Roberto Olson

AI Engineer & Automation Developer. Industrial Engineering background with Data Science experience. I build AI-powered systems that run in production daily — not demos.

## What I build

### AI Sales Agent
WhatsApp-based agent with 3 RAG knowledge bases (Supabase + OpenAI embeddings), automated document ingestion with OCR fallback, structured lead collection, and auto-creation in Pipedrive with intelligent rep assignment across 18 sales reps.

### MuchoSurf — [muchosurfco.com](https://muchosurfco.com)
Real-time surf forecasting platform with live HLS webcams across Mexican surf spots, marine weather APIs, DVR functionality, and subscription model. Full stack (Next.js, PostgreSQL, Raspberry Pi) built AI-first with Claude Code and Traycer.ai.

### B2B Lead Gen Pipeline
Apify scrapes Google Maps → deduplicates against Pipedrive → GPT-4 generates personalized outreach → multi-channel delivery. 100+ qualified leads/week.

### Automated RAG Ingestion
OneDrive → Google Drive sync triggers n8n workflows that process PDFs, Excel, Word, Google Docs. Quality gate detects bad extraction, falls back to OCR (iLovePDF API). Auto-chunks, embeds, and stores in Supabase vector tables. File updates purge and re-ingest automatically.
